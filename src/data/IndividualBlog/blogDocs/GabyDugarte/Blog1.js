          A couple of weeks ago I was in English class, as I am every Wednesday.
          When class begins, the teacher usually starts with a conversation
          about a topic that can generate a debate. This way, my classmates and
          I can practice speaking English more fluently. On this occasion, she
          began our discussion with the following phrase: “Love is a decision.”
          She affirmed that love is not a feeling. Instead, it’s a decision
          where your personal interests are the deciding factor, and these
          interests determine if it’s convenient for you to start forming a
          connection with someone.

          However, how true is this statement? We could say the feeling we call
          “love” is only desire and neurochemical. In more simple terms,
          physical attraction. It’s scary to think that’s the case, since when
          we die all chemical reactions in our brains come to a halt.

          At first, it made more sense the way my professor was describing it,
          backing her argument with relevant information based on her own
          experiences. It made me think perhaps I was wrong, and the correct
          answer was that love is only a chemical decision made by our brains. I
          usually don’t agree so willingly, I always try to investigate further
          and draw my own conclusions based on my beliefs and experiences.

          Further research allowed me to discover something very interesting,
          what the term “I love you” means in Japanese. If we literally
          translate it to English, it means “My energy is fine with yours”. I’d
          have to say this is what love means to me; when you find that person
          with whom you feel at peace with. Where your energies flow as one,
          allowing you to breathe deeply and feel their spirit channeling
          through you. It’s like a breath of fresh air but with experiences,
          passion, and energy.

          I can’t say that love isn’t a decision entirely, because when you’re
          with someone and you can’t be yourself and there is no flow. You know
          it’s not love but you could theoretically continue to be with that
          person romantically.

          We Americans are used to seeing love as something carnal, only of
          desire. However, if we were aware of what love really is and how
          subjective it can be, maybe we would avoid so many disappointments and
          could be happier in life overall. This way, our soul is at peace and
          our energy flows more naturally with others. That is where true
          happiness resides.
