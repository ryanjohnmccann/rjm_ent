          Many times, we have heard and talked about bacteria, but do you know
          what bacteria really is? Bacteria are apart of our daily lives and
          always will be. It was the first inhabitant of our planet and is still
          currently found everywhere. From the crater of a volcano to the inside
          of your body. A few years ago, it was believed that they did not exist
          in breast milk or the placenta, but recent studies now show that to be
          false!

          Bacteria are living beings that are so small they can only be observed
          through a microscope. Imagine having a grain of sand in your hand, now
          divide that by one-thousand and you’ll get a sense of how small
          bacteria can be. Despite their tiny sizes, if we put all the bacteria
          in the world on one side of the scale and the other side all humans,
          where do you think the balance would be? If you thought towards the
          human side, that is wrong. The weight of bacteria would be more than a
          thousand times greater than the weight of all humans that exist on
          Earth. In fact, the intestine of an adult person houses up to 1 kg.
          Most of them are found in our gastrointestinal tract, mouth, and skin.
          We all have different bacteria in our body, there isn’t a human being
          with the same combination of bacteria as you. Even if you have a twin
          brother! Some say you should be proud of having your own mix of
          bacteria.

          Did you know that in our mouths there are more bacteria than humans in
          the world? So, the next time you kiss someone, remember that you
          aren’t only expressing your love, you’re also sharing millions of
          bacteria. But don’t be alarmed, not all of them are bad. Many of them
          help control the growth of harmful bacteria and protect us from those
          that cause diseases. In fact, some are necessary to carry out vital
          functions and allow our survival. A recent study reported that the
          disorganization of the intestinal microbiota can have a negative
          impact on your mental health. It’s incredible how such tiny beings can
          almost take over our behavior.

          Despite the importance of bacteria, as of now less than one percent of
          the total bacteria that exist on our planet has been studied. Each
          bacterium is a full world of curiosities. Perhaps the next bacterium
          to be discovered may produce a total cure for something like HIV,
          cancer, or the coronavirus. That bacteria could be closer than you
          think, maybe it’s even in the backyard of your house!
